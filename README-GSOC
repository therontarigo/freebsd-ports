    $ git diff f2e513ea5bd3d9a611441ede0d718f4cdf50ab9f

Test the separated build: (run as non-root user)
    Turn on the new mode:
    $ export PORTS_SEPARATED_BUILD=1

    Allow to work in checked-out location:
    $ export PORTSDIR=$PWD
    $ export PORT_DBDIR=$PWD/portdb

    Avoid anything trying to read /usr/local (that should be an error):
    $ export LOCALBASE=/usr/nlocal

    Build something:
    $ make -C devel/gmake
    (asks for su password several times, due to usage of chroot, which will be
    removed)
