Intercepts libc filesystem operations to hide the real filesystem from the
process and provide instead a configurable namespace mapping virtual locations
to real locations.

This library cannot be used to restrict access to the underlying filesystem; a
program may trivially work around the interception mechanism.
This tool is not intended for use by superuser; superuser-only syscalls are not
supported.
